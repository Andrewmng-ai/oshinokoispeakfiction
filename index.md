How the Human-Animal Connection Helps Pi Survive in Life of Pi

	In the real world, animals help us survive, either providing food or helping us emotionally. In Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, the main character, Pi, has a special connection with the animals which helps him survive physically, mentally, and pushes Pi to learn new things about survival, keeping him safe and helping him whilst he is lost at sea, showing how the will to survive can not be broken even in dire situations. Firstly, during Pi’s duration at sea, animals help Pi survive by helping him physically. 
The human-animal connection that Pi has with sea life helps him stay healthy by providing him with food. Pi states, “At such times I hunted [fish] far beyond the needs of my hunger (...) let alone space in my stomach to eat them.” (Martel, 217). This quote shows how sea life helps him stay healthy and fed when he will ultimately run out of survival rations. This helps him survive because if Pi had not had these different kinds of sea life for sustenance, he would have starved soon after running out of rations, or have been attacked by Richard Parker due to his hunting instinct and need for food. Another way how the animals help Pi physically is by providing him with exercise. Pi says, “And hauling a struggling 130-pound turtle aboard was anything but easy (...) I pulled until I thought my arms would come apart (...)” (217). This shows how the turtles not only provide Pi with food, but with exercise too. This helps him survive because in the confines of his raft and the lifeboat, there is not much room to move around which means that Pi’s muscles would deteriorate from lack of exertion. This means Pi would not be able to survive because he would not be able to catch as many turtles or fish for food. Finally, animals help Pi by giving him shelter from the elements. Pi notes, “And when the elements had destroyed the blankets beyond repair, I used the [turtle] shells to protect myself from the sun by propping them against each other and lying beneath them.” (236). Another example of how animals help Pi physically, the quote describes how Pi uses the turtle's shells to help Pi physically by providing him with shelter after his main means of shelter, his blankets, were destroyed. Shelter is extremely important to Pi’s survival because exposure to the environment can kill as well as hunger or thirst.
Secondly, when Pi is lost at sea, the animals help his mental health, motivating him to survive. First of all, when the orangutan, Orange Juice, appears she comforts Pi to see another friendly face, keeping him on-task. Pi observes, “She came floating on an island of bananas in a halo of light, as lovely as the Virgin Mary (...) ‘I love you.’” (123). Orange Juice’s arrival helps Pi stay on task and prevents him from dwelling on his situation and the family he lost, but instead to focus on the problem at hand. This helps him survive because if Pi had not been alert in the first place, he could have gotten hurt by the hyena or have lost hope of his survival.  The animals also help Pi by distracting him from his seemingly hopeless situation. Pi realizes, “The feeling of busyness was profoundly satisfying; I hadn’t thought at all about my plight or myself.” (206). This quote describes how fishing distracts Pi far better than other activities. This is an essential part of his survival because Pi reads in the survival manual that the mind should always be occupied. Fishing helps him survive because if he had spent all of his time thinking about his dilemma instead of being productive, life would have been a lot more difficult on the lifeboat and raft. Lastly, another example of how animals help Pi survive mentally is how Richard Parker gives him the will to live. Pi says, “A part of me did not want Richard Parker to die at all, because if he died I would be left alone with despair (...) If I still had the will to live, it was thanks to Richard Parker.” (182). Even though Pi is in an extremely perilous situation because of Richard Parker, he still wants Richard Parker to live because he gives Pi the will to live. This is a key factor in his survival because if Pi had no will to live, he would have given up sooner as he sees no point in living anymore. 	
Lastly, the animals provide Pi with wisdom about how to survive at sea. One tool that Pi learns from the animals is how to conserve energy. Pi observes, “The dorado did a most extraordinary thing as it died: it began to flash all kinds of colours in rapid succession.” (205). As Pi catches his first fish, a dorado, he learns how the dorado flashes different colors as it dies. This helps Pi survive because when Pi notices that a dorado is flashing different colors, he knows to stop attacking it to save energy, meaning he has more for more essential tasks like catching fish or tending to his raft and equipment. Another example of what Pi learns is how to fish effectively. Pi states, “Experience taught me that it was better to strike when I felt I had a good chance of success than to strike wildly, for a fish learns from experience too, and rarely falls for the same trap twice.” (215). In this quote, it shows how Pi learns how to better his fishing by observing the behaviors and patterns of the sea life. This helps Pi survive because it helps him obtain more fish, meaning he has more food and energy, also keeping Richard Parker alive and fed, so that the chances of Pi being attacked by Richard Parker out of hunger is lowered. Finally, Pi learns how to keep himself safe during the training sessions between him and the tiger, Richard Parker. Pi discovers, “Eventually I learned to read the signals he was sending me (...) I learned to back down before he lifted his paw in the air.” (229). In this quote, it shows how Pi learns how to stay unharmed during his time training Richard Parker by paying attention to Richard Parker's body language in order to avoid being hurt. This newfound skill helps Pi survive because if he had not learned when to back off, there is no guarantee that the turtle’s shell would protect him from every one of Richard Parker's attacks. 	
Overall, Pi’s connection with the different animals he interacts with helps him survive on the lifeboat by helping him physically, mentally, and bestowing him valuable knowledge about survival. Showing us how the will to live is extremely resilient, helping humans develop rapidly and successfully even in harsh conditions.
